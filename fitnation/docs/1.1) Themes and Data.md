## 2. Core Elements

### 2.1 Styling and Theming

*   **Color Palette:** Defined in `lib/core/themes/colors.dart`. Uses a black and red theme.
    *   Primary: `#FF3333` (Red)
    *   Primary Foreground: `#FFFFFF` (White)
    *   Secondary: `#1A1A1A` (Black)
    *   Secondary Foreground: `#FFFFFF` (White)
    *   Background: Dark background (e.g., `#121212` or similar dark gray)
    *   Foreground: Light text (e.g., `#E0E0E0`)
    *   Muted Background: `#2A2A2A` (Slightly lighter black)
    *   Muted Foreground: `#A1A1A1` (Gray)
    *   Accent: `#FF3333` (Red)
    *   Card Background: `#1A1A1A` (Black)
    *   Card Foreground: `#FFFFFF` (White)
    *   Input Fill Color: `#2A2A2A`
    *   Input Border Color: `#424242`
*   **Typography:** Defined in `lib/core/themes/text_styles.dart`. Uses the Inter font family. Styles are defined for headings (H1-H3), body text, small text, and extra small text with specified sizes and weights.
*   **ThemeData:** Configured in `lib/core/themes/themes.dart`. Sets up the overall `ThemeData.dark()` using the defined colors and text styles, applying styles to common Material widgets like `AppBar`, `Card`, `ButtonTheme`, `InputDecorationTheme`, `TabBarTheme`, etc., ensuring consistent spacing, padding, margins, and border radii as per UI guidelines.

### 2.2 Data Handling

*   **Backend:** Supabase is used as the backend.
*   **API Service:** All backend interactions (fetching, mutations, storage) are handled by methods within `lib/api/API_Services.dart`. This centralizes API logic.
*   **Data Models:** Data structures are defined in `lib/models/`. `fromJson` and `toJson` methods are included for serialization/deserialization, crucial for working with Supabase responses and potentially local storage.

### 2.3 State Management

*   **Riverpod:** The application uses `flutter_riverpod` for state management.
*   **Providers:** Providers (`lib/providers/`) are used to expose data fetched from `API_Services.dart` (`FutureProvider`, `StreamProvider`) and manage complex UI or application states (`StateNotifier`, `AsyncNotifier`, `StateProvider`). This allows widgets to efficiently watch for data changes and rebuild accordingly.

### 2.4 Navigation

Standard Flutter `Navigator` is used. `lib/Screens/NavPages.dart` likely implements the `BottomNavigationBar`, managing the display of the main tab screens (`HomeScreen`, `WorkoutScreen.dart`, `CommunityHome.dart`, `ProfileScreen.dart`).

### 2.5 Reusable Components

*   **`lib/core/components/`**: Contains fundamental UI components like `PrimaryButton.dart` and `ResponsiveCenter.dart` that can be used anywhere in the app.
*   **`lib/widgets/`**: Contains UI components that are reusable but often specific to a feature area (e.g., `widgets/community/PostCard.dart`, `widgets/Activities/WorkoutCard.dart`).
